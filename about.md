<h2> Me Shortly </h2>

I am Farid, I was born in Ganja(Azerbaijan), I studied in Izmir(Turkey) and now I live in Bursa(Turkey). Shortly after the day, I saw a computer for the first time, I realized that I am going to die with this thing. As a fellow millennial, who was born in Azerbaijan and raised bilingual, I was very lucky to be able to use the power of the Russian language in 2000s. Thanks to countless sharing people in online chats, forums, and blogs, I was able to learn many things about information technology. I enjoyed gradually learning how computer networks work, how an operating system was designed, the beauty of computer hardware, the elegance of hacking, the thrill of reverse engineering and amazing power, and fun of programming languages such as C++, VB.NET, PHP, Assembler, etc. Fast forward a few years, I earned a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Process Engineering from Izmir Institute of Technology and bitterly realized that not every field integrates computer science at the same rate. Currently, I am about to complete my Master's Degree in Biotechnology and Bioengineering program with a thesis focus on microbiome research.

I believe that the Era of Big data will change our civilization in many ways, and without a doubt, biological data will help scholars to reveal some of the most amazing and unknown things about this world.
